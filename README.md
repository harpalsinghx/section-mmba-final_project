# 📊 BW-AI-Agent: SAP BW Object Analyzer and Documentation Generator

## 🚀 Project Overview

**BW-AI-Agent** is an intelligent assistant designed to analyze metadata and logic within SAP BW (Business Warehouse) environments. It scans BW objects (InfoProviders, Transformations, DTPs, Queries), reads embedded ABAP code, traces object dependencies, and outputs structured technical documentation and lineage maps.

This project addresses the **complexity and opacity** of traditional SAP BW landscapes, where understanding data flow, logic, and dependencies across hundreds of interconnected objects often relies on tribal knowledge or laborious manual documentation.

The agent is especially valuable for:

* ✅ Upgrades to **BW/4HANA**
* ✅ Transitions to **SAP Datasphere**
* ✅ Migrations to modern cloud data platforms such as **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, or **Azure Synapse**

By automating the discovery, documentation, and analysis process, the BW-AI-Agent significantly:

* 🔄 **Reduces manual effort**
* ⚡ **Accelerates project timelines**
* 🎯 **Increases accuracy** for migration and transformation logic translation

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### 🏗️ Architecture Diagram

```
SAP BW System  -->  Metadata Extractor (ABAP/XML/SQL)  -->  AI Pipeline  -->  Outputs
                                                           ↓
                                                 Vector DB / RAG Store
                                                           ↓
                                                   Structured Outputs + Docs
```

### ⚙️ Key Technologies

* `Python` for orchestration and ETL
* `LangChain` / `LlamaIndex` for RAG pipelines
* `OpenAI GPT-4` or `Azure OpenAI` for code summarization
* `Streamlit`, `Flask` for frontend UI
* `Mermaid.js` for lineage diagrams
* `Jupyter` for prototyping and notebooks

### ☁️ Deployment Options

* Web-based internal tooling
* Secure cloud deployment for enterprise (Azure, GCP, AWS)

## 💬 Example Prompts & Outputs

### 📥 Prompt 1: Transformation Analysis

```json
{
  "object_type": "Transformation",
  "source": "ZODS_SALES",
  "target": "ZCUBE_PROFIT",
  "routine": {
    "type": "End Routine",
    "code": "LOOP AT RESULT_PACKAGE..."
  }
}
```

### 📤 Expected Output

```json
{
  "summary": "This end routine aggregates sales data by customer and month, applying currency conversion via function module Z_CONVERT_CURR. Fields ZNET_SALES and ZGROSS_PROFIT are calculated.",
  "dependencies": ["ZODS_SALES", "ZCUBE_PROFIT", "Z_CONVERT_CURR"],
  "lineage": "ZODS_SALES → ZCUBE_PROFIT"
}
```

### 🧠 Prompt 2: ABAP Routine Summary

> Summarize the logic in the following ABAP start routine and identify any table or function module dependencies.

### ✅ Output Includes

Evaluation Strategy

We will use a combination of:
	Manual QA: Comparing AI outputs to known documentation
	Developer feedback on usefulness of ABAP summaries
	Unit tests for prompt templates and output parsing

Metrics:
	Accuracy of lineage mapping (manual validation)
	Time saved per object compared to manual analysis
	Feedback scores from expert SAP users

Observability Plan

We plan to track:
	Prompt execution logs and token usage (via LangChain or OpenAI SDK)
	Error rates (e.g., parsing failures, missing outputs)
	User interaction logs (which outputs are downloaded, revised, etc.)

We may also integrate with tools like:

Langfuse or PromptLayer for prompt monitoring
Grafana + Prometheus for system metrics if deployed as a service

If you're a data engineer or SAP architect tired of tracing InfoObjects manually or reverse-engineering ABAP logic under time pressure — BW-AI-Agent is for you.
