# ðŸ“Š BW-AI-Agent: SAP BW Object Analyzer and Documentation Generator

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**BW-AI-Agent** is an intelligent assistant designed to analyze metadata and logic within SAP BW (Business Warehouse) environments. It scans BW objects (InfoProviders, Transformations, DTPs, Queries), reads embedded ABAP code, traces object dependencies, and outputs structured technical documentation and lineage maps.

This project addresses the **complexity and opacity** of traditional SAP BW landscapes, where understanding data flow, logic, and dependencies across hundreds of interconnected objects often relies on tribal knowledge or laborious manual documentation.

The agent is especially valuable for:

* âœ… Upgrades to **BW/4HANA**
* âœ… Transitions to **SAP Datasphere**
* âœ… Migrations to modern cloud data platforms such as **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, or **Azure Synapse**

By automating the discovery, documentation, and analysis process, the BW-AI-Agent significantly:

* ðŸ”„ **Reduces manual effort**
* âš¡ **Accelerates project timelines**
* ðŸŽ¯ **Increases accuracy** for migration and transformation logic translation

Use Case & Workflow

Target Users:
	SAP BW Architects
	Data Engineers
	Consultants performing BW-to-Datasphere or BW-to-cloud transitions
	Audit & Compliance teams

Workflow:
1) The user extracts or connects metadata from SAP BW.
2) The BW-AI-Agent processes metadata and code via AI pipelines.
3) The system produces:
   Lineage graphs
   ABAP routine summaries
   Field-level mappings
   Query structure documentation
4) The user downloads or integrates the outputs into project documentation, assessment reports, or migration plans and potentially use this to automate migration/upgrades

AI Impact:
	Automates metadata analysis, eliminating hours of manual inspection.
	Summarizes complex ABAP logic using natural language.
	Connects objects semantically, aiding lineage and impact assessment.
	Generates clear documentation that supports knowledge transfer, compliance, and cloud data migration efforts.

AI Features to Be Implemented

Feature												Description																					Justification

Prompt Engineering									Carefully crafted prompts to interpret ABAP, metadata, and relationships.					Ensures consistency and structure in AI analysis across diverse object types.

Structured Outputs									Outputs in JSON or Markdown, including ABAP summaries, lineage trees, and data flows.		Enables downstream automation (e.g., documentation generation, visualization).

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)				Optional connection to a metadata/document store to provide object context 					Adds precision and context to LLM responses, especially in large landscapes.

Vector Database										Index and search past objects or code snippets semantically.								Enables historical comparison, reuse of transformation logic, and smart lookup.

Evaluation Framework								Manual and programmatic evaluation of output quality using checklists and criteria.			Ensures quality and prevents misinterpretation of logic.

Observability Tools 								Track usage patterns, error rates, and latency.												Supports debugging, performance optimization, and audit trails.


Technical Approach

Architecture Overview:

SAP BW System  -->  Metadata Extractor (ABAP/XML/SQL)  -->  AI Pipeline  -->  Outputs
                                                           â†“
                                                 Vector DB / RAG Store
                                                           â†“
                                                   Structured Outputs + Docs


Key Technologies:
	Python for ETL, code orchestration
	LangChain or LlamaIndex for prompt routing and RAG
	OpenAI GPT-4 API (or Azure OpenAI) for ABAP/code summarization
	ChromaDB or Weaviate as the vector store for object metadata
	Mermaid.js for visual lineage diagrams
	Jupyter Notebooks for prototype evaluation

Deployment Options:
	Local script-based utility
	Lightweight web app for internal consultants
	Enterprise deployment on Azure/GCP with secure BW connectivity

Example Prompts & Expected Outputs

Prompt 1:

{
  "object_type": "Transformation",
  "source": "ZODS_SALES",
  "target": "ZCUBE_PROFIT",
  "routine": {
    "type": "End Routine",
    "code": "LOOP AT RESULT_PACKAGE..."
  }
}

Expected Output:

{
  "summary": "This end routine aggregates sales data by customer and month, applying currency conversion via function module Z_CONVERT_CURR. Fields ZNET_SALES and ZGROSS_PROFIT are calculated.",
  "dependencies": ["ZODS_SALES", "ZCUBE_PROFIT", "Z_CONVERT_CURR"],
  "lineage": "ZODS_SALES â†’ ZCUBE_PROFIT"
}

Prompt 2:

"Summarize the logic in the following ABAP start routine and identify any table or function module dependencies."

Output:
	Bullet-point logic summary
	Tables/functions used
	Potential runtime issues (e.g., hard-coded values, SELECT SINGLE in loop)

Evaluation Strategy

We will use a combination of:
	Manual QA: Comparing AI outputs to known documentation
	Developer feedback on usefulness of ABAP summaries
	Unit tests for prompt templates and output parsing

Metrics:
	Accuracy of lineage mapping (manual validation)
	Time saved per object compared to manual analysis
	Feedback scores from expert SAP users

Observability Plan

We plan to track:
	Prompt execution logs and token usage (via LangChain or OpenAI SDK)
	Error rates (e.g., parsing failures, missing outputs)
	User interaction logs (which outputs are downloaded, revised, etc.)

We may also integrate with tools like:

Langfuse or PromptLayer for prompt monitoring
Grafana + Prometheus for system metrics if deployed as a service

If you're a data engineer or SAP architect tired of tracing InfoObjects manually or reverse-engineering ABAP logic under time pressure â€” BW-AI-Agent is for you.
