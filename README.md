#  BW-AI-Agent: SAP BW Object Analyzer and Documentation Generator

##  Project Overview

**BW-AI-Agent** is an intelligent assistant designed to analyze metadata and logic within SAP BW (Business Warehouse) environments. It scans BW objects (InfoProviders, Transformations, DTPs, Queries), reads embedded ABAP code, traces object dependencies, and outputs structured technical documentation and lineage maps.

This project addresses the **complexity and opacity** of traditional SAP BW landscapes, where understanding data flow, logic, and dependencies across hundreds of interconnected objects often relies on tribal knowledge or laborious manual documentation.

The agent is especially valuable for:

* Upgrades to **BW/4HANA**
* Transitions to **SAP Datasphere**
*  Migrations to modern cloud data platforms such as **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, or **Azure Synapse**

By automating the discovery, documentation, and analysis process, the BW-AI-Agent significantly:

* **Reduces manual effort**
* **Accelerates project timelines**
*  **Increases accuracy** for migration and transformation logic translation

| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prompt Engineering**                   | Tailored prompts to handle ABAP logic and BW metadata             | Ensures accuracy and relevance in AI interpretations               |
| **Structured Outputs**                   | Outputs in JSON, Markdown, or tabular formats                     | Enables integration into automated tooling and documentation flows |
| **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | Connects to metadata store for context-aware prompts              | Improves precision and continuity of analysis                      |
| **Vector Database**                      | Semantic indexing of BW objects and code (e.g., Chroma, Weaviate) | Enables quick retrieval of similar logic and relationships         |
| **Evaluation Framework**                 | Unit tests, LLM accuracy checks, manual validations               | Ensures system effectiveness and correctness                       |
| **Observability Tools**                  | Logs, traceability, performance metrics                           | Critical for enterprise-grade monitoring and governance            |

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### 🏗️ Architecture Diagram

```
SAP BW System  -->  Metadata Extractor (ABAP/XML/SQL)  -->  AI Pipeline  -->  Outputs
                                                           ↓
                                                 Vector DB / RAG Store
                                                           ↓
                                                   Structured Outputs + Docs
```

### ⚙ Key Technologies

* `Python` for orchestration and ETL
* `LangChain` / `LlamaIndex` for RAG pipelines
* `OpenAI GPT-4` or `Azure OpenAI` for code summarization
* `Streamlit`, `Flask` for frontend UI
* `Mermaid.js` for lineage diagrams
* `Jupyter` for prototyping and notebooks

### ☁Deployment Options

* Web-based internal tooling
* Secure cloud deployment for enterprise (Azure, GCP, AWS)

## 💬 Example Prompts & Outputs

###  Prompt 1: Transformation Analysis

```json
{
  "object_type": "Transformation",
  "source": "ZODS_SALES",
  "target": "ZCUBE_PROFIT",
  "routine": {
    "type": "End Routine",
    "code": "LOOP AT RESULT_PACKAGE..."
  }
}
```

### Expected Output

```json
{
  "summary": "This end routine aggregates sales data by customer and month, applying currency conversion via function module Z_CONVERT_CURR. Fields ZNET_SALES and ZGROSS_PROFIT are calculated.",
  "dependencies": ["ZODS_SALES", "ZCUBE_PROFIT", "Z_CONVERT_CURR"],
  "lineage": "ZODS_SALES → ZCUBE_PROFIT"
}
```

###  Prompt 2: ABAP Routine Summary

> Summarize the logic in the following ABAP start routine and identify any table or function module dependencies.

###  Output Includes

* Step-by-step logic explanation
* Referenced function modules and tables
* Code smell or performance warnings

---
##  Evaluation Strategy

###  Methods

* Manual review against known logic
* Precision/recall testing on detected dependencies
* SAP expert feedback

###  Metrics

* % accuracy of lineage mapping
* Time saved vs manual review
* ABAP summary quality ratings (from developers)

---

## Observability Plan

Track and monitor:

* Prompt performance and API usage
* Error logs and response failures
* Usage analytics (object types, frequency

### Tools

* `Langfuse`, `PromptLayer` for prompt monitoring
* `Grafana + Prometheus` for infra metrics
* Usage log tracking for feedback loop
